# cenTeX - A TeX macro pacakge

This `TeX` macro package was used to process technical documents at NATO SACLANTCEN.

Note that this is a macro package built on top of the plain `TeX` format, and is not a `LaTeX` format 
(although there was a subsequent port to `LaTeX`.)

The `cenTeX`  macro package was developed within the Scientific
and Technical Information (STI) Department of NATO SACLANTCEN for preparing
scientific documents for publication (and included in this category were
Management documents relating to the scientific programme). 

A fairly extensive set of macros specifically tailored for SACLANTCEN 
documents was layered on top of the `PLAIN` base.  This format was
preloaded into `TeX` and is called `cenTeX`.  The aims of `cenTeX` were to provide
appropriate formatting for different document types, to facilitate some of 
the more complex document structures (such as tabular information, page
composition, etc.), to enable a simple means to integrate graphics into the
document, to encourage a certain discipline in file-naming, presentation, 
etc., and to elicit and verify document declarations.
